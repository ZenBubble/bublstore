# bublstore
Full stack project made for a mock website offering video editing services. Self-hosted backend with a simple html + css frontend

## Features
- (WIP) Basic front end made in html + css. Not really the main focus of this project, but useful to learn.
- (WIP) Backend server for saving customer account information + cart/wishlist, hosted from personal home server. This is the main focus of this project, as I want to explore more of the backend stuff as well as information encryption.
- (WIP) Django code base. This is meant for learning more of the python syntax as well as using a new framework.
