# bublstore
Full stack project made for a mock website offering various services. Self-hosted PostgreSQL backend with a simple html + tailwind frontend

## Features 
### ❤️ = Not yet implemented 
### 💛 = Actively being developed 
### 💚 = Implemented
- 💚 Django code base for saving customer account information + cart + reviews. This is meant for learning more of the python syntax as well as using a new backend framework.
- 💚 Basic front end made in html + tailwind. Not really the main focus of this project, but useful to learn.
- 💛 All in one dockerized version to learn docker.
- 💛 Automated tests using Django tests as well as GitHub actions. This is for learning CI/CD and program testing.
- 💛 Clippy type mascot that details what each page is and how it was implemented. Since its 2025, I'll also build a RAG using Ollama + local deepseek for simple user queuries like "do you offer ___." (NOT A CHATGPT WRAPPER)
- ❤️ Custom user authentication (password encryption) and home server hosting. This is to explore more of information encryption and web protocols.
